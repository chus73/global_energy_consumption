Visualization created in Tableau using International Energy Agency data to show the evolution of the electricity MIX over the last decade. It is composed of three presentations where the evolution of the mix is analyzed.

## Power Mix distribution by area
Using a sankey chart we show the emergence of China and India as major consumers and the shift towards renewables in western industrialized countries. Countries are shown in aggregate according to their OECD membership.

We will go into more detail by making an evolution of the Sankey chart, but showing the data for countries without aggregation.
